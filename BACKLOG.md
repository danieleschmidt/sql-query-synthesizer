## High Impact / Medium Effort (WSJF Score: High)

### 🔧 Architecture Improvements
1. **Implement Service Layer pattern** (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)
   - Split QueryAgent into focused services (QueryService, SQLGenerator, QueryValidator)
   - Reduce tight coupling and improve testability
   - File: sql_synthesizer/query_agent.py (currently 200+ lines with multiple responsibilities)
   - WSJF Score: 7/10

## Medium Impact / High Effort (WSJF Score: Low-Medium)

### 🔧 Advanced Architecture
1. **Abstract OpenAI adapter interface** (Impact: High, Effort: High)
   - Development plan epic (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md:66)
   - Enables multi-provider LLM support (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
   - File: sql_synthesizer/openai_adapter.py
   - Major architectural change, high complexity

2. **Add configuration for cache backend** (Impact: Low, Effort: Medium)
   - Development plan requirement (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md:56)
   - Support Redis, Memcached for distributed caching
   - Currently hardcoded TTLCache

## Low Priority / Future Iterations

### 🌐 Features & Expansion
5. **Add responsive HTML templates** (Impact: Low, Effort: Medium)
   - Development plan requirement (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md:59)
   - Web UI improvements for better mobile/tablet experience

6. **Deploy demo environment** (Impact: Low, Effort: High)
   - Development plan requirement (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md:41)
   - Public demo for marketing and user onboarding

7. **Add async support for I/O operations** (Impact: Medium, Effort: High)
   - Improve performance for concurrent database operations
   - Enable better scalability under load

## Technical Debt Log

### Code Quality Issues
- Missing type hints in some functions
- Hardcoded timeouts and retry logic
- No connection pooling for database operations
- No graceful error handling for LLM API failures

### Security Concerns
- SQL injection risk if user input not properly sanitized
- API keys might be logged in debug mode
- No rate limiting on API endpoints

### Performance Issues
- No async support for I/O operations
- Cache invalidation strategy needs improvement
- No query result pagination

## Next Actions (Iteration 1 Focus)
1. Fix python-dotenv dependency issue
2. Install and configure pre-commit hooks
3. Add input validation for SQL injection prevention
4. Improve test coverage to 85%
5. Add structured logging

## Success Metrics - Current Status
- ✅ Test coverage >80% (Currently: 83% with 58 tests)
- ✅ CI pipeline stable and automated
- ✅ 100% secrets from environment (no hardcoded credentials)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks active (secret scanning)
- ✅ Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ User-friendly error messages with suggestions
- ✅ Structured logging with trace IDs
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

## Autonomous Development Iteration Summary (2025-07-20)

### Completed Tasks (4 major items, WSJF scores: 8/10, 7/10)
