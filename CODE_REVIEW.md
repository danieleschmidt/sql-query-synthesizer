# Code Review Report

## Overview
This review evaluates the most recent commit `cefab79` on branch `work`. The repository provides a natural-language-to-SQL agent with validation utilities. Key changes introduce SQL validation, a query agent with simple relationship inference, schema introspection, and documentation updates.

## Static Analysis
- **ruff**: No linting issues (`ruff check . --fix`).
- **bandit**: Reports three medium-severity warnings (`B608` hardcoded SQL expressions) in `src/sql_query_synthesizer/agent.py` due to string-formatted SQL generation.

## Testing
- All unit tests pass (`pytest -q` -> 9 passed).

## Functionality
- `validate_sql` parses SQL using `sqlparse` and returns `ValidationResult` with suggestions for `SELECT *` and missing `WHERE` clauses.
- `QueryAgent` infers tables mentioned in prompts, performs simple join logic based on discovered foreign keys, validates generated SQL, executes it, and returns results with validation details.
- Documentation covers usage of `ValidationResult` and contribution instructions for extending validation rules.
- Sprint board and development plan updated to mark relevant tasks complete.

## Observations
- The project includes minimal error handling when database connection or SQL execution fails; consider adding try/except blocks to surface user-friendly errors.
- SQL is constructed via f-strings, which `bandit` flags as potential injection risks. Parameterized queries would be safer.
- Schema introspection uses SQLAlchemy inspectors without caching; for large schemas this may incur performance costs on each agent initialization.

## Recommendations
1. Address `bandit` warnings by using parameterized queries or ORM query builders to avoid SQL injection vectors.
2. Expand unit tests to cover error cases (invalid connection URLs, malformed prompts, etc.).
3. Consider adding configuration for caching introspected schema results to improve startup performance.
