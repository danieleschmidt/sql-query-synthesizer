# Project Charter - SQL Query Synthesizer

## Executive Summary
The SQL Query Synthesizer is a production-ready natural language to SQL conversion system designed to democratize database access while maintaining enterprise-grade security and performance standards.

## Problem Statement
- **Business Challenge**: Technical barriers prevent non-technical users from accessing valuable data insights trapped in SQL databases
- **Technical Gap**: Existing solutions lack comprehensive security, performance optimization, and enterprise integration capabilities
- **Market Need**: Growing demand for self-service analytics tools that maintain data governance and security standards

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Natural language to SQL query conversion using large language models
- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Enterprise security features (SQL injection prevention, audit logging, rate limiting)
- High-performance async operations with connection pooling
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- Interactive web interface and CLI tools
- Caching strategies for improved performance
- Circuit breaker patterns for LLM provider resilience

### Out of Scope
- Database administration or schema modification
- Data visualization or reporting dashboards
- User management systems (authentication handled externally)
- Real-time streaming data processing

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Accuracy**: 95%+ success rate for natural language query conversion
2. **Security**: Zero successful SQL injection attacks in production
3. **Performance**: Sub-2 second response times for 90% of queries
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper circuit breaker implementation
5. **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent users

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Query conversion accuracy rate
- Security incident frequency
- Average response time
- System uptime percentage
- User adoption metrics
- Code coverage percentage (target: 85%+)
- Security audit compliance score

## Stakeholder Alignment

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Core maintainers and contributors
- **Security Team**: Compliance and security oversight
- **End Users**: Business analysts, data scientists, and researchers
- **Infrastructure Team**: Deployment and operations support

### Stakeholder Responsibilities
- **Product Owner**: Feature prioritization and requirements validation
- **Tech Lead**: Architecture decisions and code quality standards
- **Security Champion**: Security review and vulnerability assessment
- **DevOps Lead**: CI/CD pipeline and deployment automation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated through AST-based validation and parameterized queries
2. **LLM Provider Outages**: Addressed via circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms
3. **Data Privacy Concerns**: Managed through comprehensive audit logging and access controls
4. **Performance Degradation**: Prevented through multi-tier caching and connection pooling

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Third-party Dependencies**: Regular security scanning and automated updates
2. **Database Compatibility**: Comprehensive testing across supported database types
3. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Performance monitoring and load testing

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ with type hints
- **Framework**: Flask for web interface, SQLAlchemy for database abstraction
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API with circuit breaker patterns
- **Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite with async drivers
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached, and in-memory options

### Development Tools
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, pylint, mypy, ruff
- **Security**: Bandit, safety, pre-commit hooks
- **Documentation**: Sphinx with OpenAPI integration

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with 85%+ coverage requirement
- Integration tests for database connectivity
- Security tests for injection prevention
- Performance tests for scalability validation
- End-to-end tests for user workflows

### Code Quality Standards
