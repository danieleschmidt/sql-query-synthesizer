- **Testing Gate**: 85% coverage, all tests pass
- **Performance Gate**: No >5% regression
- **Build Gate**: Successful packaging + container security
- **Deployment Gate**: Health checks + config validation

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure
✅ **Makefile Integration** - Uses existing `make` commands  
✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Leverages existing quality gates  
✅ **Docker Configuration** - Enhances existing containerization  
✅ **Terraform Integration** - Validates existing IaC  
✅ **Testing Framework** - Builds on existing pytest setup  

### Security-First Design
